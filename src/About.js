// "I’ve always admired how thoughtful design has the power to change our world. Whether it’s through simplifying one interaction or giving users an opportunity to view things through a new lens, I love working on projects that make people happy. The thing i love most about being a UX Designer is the ability to make things stand out and differ from others to make each thing unique in their own way!"
